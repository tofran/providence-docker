## Attribution and acknowledgement

This image is based on the stale project created by 
[Governo Regional dos AÃ§ores](https://github.com/GovernoRegionalAcores/collectiveaccess).
Thank you Alberto Branco and Pedro Amorim.
This is a hard fork, the main changes are:

- Simplified installation, reduced docker layers, image size and unnecessary complexity;
- Removed Pawtucket, I only want a single component in this image;
- Enable configuration via environment variables;
- Improved scripts resiliency, code smells and overall tried to make everything production ready.
